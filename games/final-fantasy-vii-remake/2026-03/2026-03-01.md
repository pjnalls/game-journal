In addition to the mysterious man that appears from time to time, Cloud met a girl selling flowers and reunited with his childhood friend.

Let's analyze all three of these new charaters an their relation to Cloud and the plot.

## Chapter 2 — Fateful Encounters

Right off the bat, I must say, I absolutely love the amount of detail that the FFVIIR creators put into the streets of Sector 8 and the rest of the game. There is a **sheer** number of NPCs with their own dialogues and side stories, which immerse me into this wonderfully scaled FF7 world...! 😊

Of course, on the other hand, it's extremely sad to see the devastation the destruction of Mako Reactor 1 caused and for Wedge, Biggs, Jessie, Barret, and Cloud witness and process the consequences of their actions.

Yet, as the game reveals, it isn't entirely their doing... 🤫

### Literary Analysis

I won't say too much in the session about the girl Cloud meets selling flowers, but as we see her in the opening of the game, we get a sense she's a central character of this world.

One detail I'd like to elaborate on is how she is seemingly junxtapost to the destruction of Mako Reactor 1, selling flowers.

She even allows Cloud to soften up his harden ex-mercenary personality by chosing to buy a flower from her to give to someone later, symbolizing the importance of resilient kindness in a world that's so cruel and unfair. 🌼

### Challenges Encountered

Cloud fights solo in this chapter, so I made sure to Potion up when ever his HP got close to 400, as the game ends if he's KO'ed. 

On Normal mode, it got a bit tricky words the last two areas in Sector 8 because my MP ran low, as casting Fire is one of the quickest ways to end the battles around you since most of the enemies are human, which are typical susceptible to Fire. 🔥

(I shouldn't probably used the grenades I found though... 💡) 

However, after casting about 2 Ethers total throughout the whole chapter, it wasn't terribly difficult.

I just made sure to search streets throughly for items I needed to collect.

## Chapter 3 — Home Sweet Slum: Part 1

I'll keep this section brief, as I haven't played to far into this chapter yet.

The destruction of Mako Reactor 1 was successful, and the hope Wedge, Biggs, Jessie, and Barret have is that the Planet's life has been significantly extended because of their mission.

It's time to settle down for the evening... 😴

...

Back at the bar Seventh Heaven, I always enjoyed watching the relationship dynamic between Barret, Tifa, and Cloud.

They're my favorite RPG trio to play with in this game! 💚
