## Introduction

This is my first Game Journal entry, as I start a new playthrough for 100% achievements of Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade (FF7R) for PC! 🎉 

FF7R is hands-down my favorite video game of all time! I'm so excited to rise to the challenge of following this GameFAQ guide [here](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps4/168653-final-fantasy-vii-remake/faqs/78459/introduction) to hopefully complete the game with all 54 achievements from the main quest and collect the other 9 needed for the INTERmission game with this one [here](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps5/426484-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-final-fantasy-vii/faqs/80554).

It's going to be my first time completing the game on normal and hard difficulty, so it should be quite the challenge that I'm looking for.

## Chapter 1 — The Destruction of Mako Reactor 1

Generally, what I'd like to do in my game entry, I think, are two things:
- Give a **literary analysis** of a game's story.
- Describe some **problems encountered** during a game and how I solved them.

### Literary Analysis

From the very beginning of the game, we're shown a bird flying from a dried-up, desert-like land surrounding Midgar, which is the city of this game, into which the bird flies.

This is symbolic of just how much devastation the overuse of mako energy, the life force of the Planet, can cause in this world.

**Life**... It's the central theme of Final Fantasy VII (FF7) in the game. 
We see particularly how not only protecting human lives, but all life on the Planet matters so much to certain key characters and even the creators of the FF7 series themselves.

Naturally, there would be conflict between those who want to exploit and harm this **Life** and those who want to protect and care for it.

So, here we are in the first chapter... an ecoterrorist group working with an ex-mercenary to save the Planet by questionable means.

### Problems Encountered

When you first get access to your Map at the entrance of the train station, you can press L2 to cycle through all the different maps. I found a mini-map new to me, and it could make navigating around Midgar a lot easier than when I played through.
