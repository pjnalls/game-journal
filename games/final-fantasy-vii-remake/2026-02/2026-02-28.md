## Chapter 1 — The Destruction of Mako Reactor 1: Part 2

I made it inside the Mako reactor yesterday with Biggs, Jessie, and Barret, and descended into the reactor's core with Jessie, Barret, and Cloud today. So far, the mission is going well as I relearned the basics better than I did in the past. 👍

### Literary Analysis

Continuing about the "life force" from the game I spoke about yesterday, Barret explained something to Cloud and Jessie as they took the elevator down to the reactor:

All life was made of this life force that the Shira cooperation exploits as Mako energy to power the city, yet **dry up the life** of the Planet. 😞

We can clearly compare the overarching, main struggle of characters in the world of FF7R to our own on Earth, and carefully think about some of our own dichotomies we face, prioritizing the use of the Earth's energy versus conserving it.

It leads us to ask, can the FF7 characters find a middle way? What about people in reality? 🙏

### Challenges Encountered

#### Sweeper Battle

Inside Mako Reactor 1, there is an enemy known as Sweeper, the game's first mini-boss. 

Since Sweeper is a mech susceptible to Thunder, the first thing I did in battle after doing a combo with Cloud in Punisher Mode was switch to Barret to shoot Overcharge shots to fill one ATB slot and cast Thunder. ⚡️

Casting Thunder pressured the Sweeper into Heat status. Then, knowing Cloud's Focused Thrust would stagger the mech, I performed the ability to do so.

Next, at this point, the mech is almost out of health, and Barret is ready for another Overcharge shot, which I dealt to end the battle. 💪

#### Scorpion Sentinel Boss Battle

Inside the core of Mako Reactor 1 on the main bridge, I fought the first boss of the game.

I won't lay out step-by-step how I defeated the boss, but I will try to describe the techniques I used in balance throughout the fight:

This mech is, as you might expect, susceptible to Thunder, so I timed the opportunities I could use it, as the Lightning Materia is equipped on Barret, whose MP was low. ⚡️

Where Barret's MP was low, yet the boss's Magic Defense was low, as well, I made sure Cloud cast Fire even if it wasn't the mech's weakness, as it still delivered sufficient damage. 🔥

I also used both Cloud's and Barret's staggering abilities, Forced Thrust and Shot, respectively, to pressure the boss at different stages of the battle, building up to a stagger where I could use Cloud's Limit Break Cross-Slash and Braver for the final blow.
